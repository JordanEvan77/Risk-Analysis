# Risk-Analysis
This particular project focuses on Value at Risk analysis(VAR), through Monte Carlo Simulations. Monte Carlo Simulations have to do with independent probabilities and the idea of true absolute randomness. This is mixed with the Black Scholes model to give us the worst possible value, given a mixture of assets(currencies), which is graphed in the currencies. The Monte Carlo VAR is a very common method used to calculate the ultimate downside to an investment portfolio. So the idea is that we run a bunch of independent iterations of the simulation(in this case using the 5 different standard deviations for each currency, mixed and matched). We do this over and over, running through all the worst possible methods of outcome, mixed with the average volatility and given rates, over the 90 days of the life span of the options. We are not trying to find the most likely occurrence here, or guarantee what could happen, but rather find the absolute “bottom”. In this scenario we can virtually make the claim that in the worst possible situations you will never lose more than this profit, with the given moves($6.33 billion). This is then graphed to show a visual version of the mixture of currencies that give us this absolute worst scenario. 
To run the program, import the attached CSV file in the environment, bring the proper installs  up to date and run the set of classes as a whole. It should produce a visual of the currencies at the end.
